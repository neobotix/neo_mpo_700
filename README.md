The omnidirectional [MPO-700](http://www.neobotix-robots.com/omnidirectional-robot-mpo-700.html) is the ideal base for high-end service robots. Its four Omni-Drive-Modules enable it to move extremely smoothly into any direction. This robot is even capable of rotating freely while driving to its destination. The Omni-Drive-Modules of the MPO-700 feature important benefits compared to other omnidirectional drive kinematics, like for example the MPO-500's Mecanum wheels.

* Fully omnidirectional manoeuvrability
* Very steady movements
* High stability and payload
* Compact, easily integrated drive units

This makes the MPO-700 a premium alternative for applications that require omnidirectional movements without the limitations of traditional kinematics.
